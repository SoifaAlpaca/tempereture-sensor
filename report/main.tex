\section{Introduction}


    The primary goal for this project is to design, implement, and evaluate a temperature meter system that integrates three distinct temperature sensors: an NTC thermistor, an LM35 analog sensor, and a DS18B20 digital sensor. The system also incorporates a relay-controlled fan and a graphical  user interface (GUI) for data visualization and control. This project aims to compare the performance of each sensor in terms of accuracy while assessing the system's overall power consumption and efficiency.


    \label{requirements}
    For the system Design it's important to define the temperature interval in which this system will work, thus it was define as $ T \in [10^\circ C; 40^\circ C]$.

\section{Temperature Sensors}
For the purpose of implementing the system described in the requirements of the labwork,
the temperature sensors described below were used. This section will describe the intrinsic
characteristics of each sensor and why they were chosen for the system design presented in the
following sections.
\subsection{NTC - Negative Temperature Coefficient}
    
    Negative temperature Coefficient (NTC), means that the sensor resistance decreases as temperature increases. This behavior exhibits a predictable response to temperature variations. Hence we need to develop a system that converts resistance to voltage, so the MCU's ADC can convert it back to ohms and finally to temperature.

            \draw [arrow] (mcu) -- (temp);
        
        \end{tikzpicture}

    \end{centering}

\subsection{LM35 - Precision Centigrade Temperature Sensor}

    The LM35 is a precision integrated-circuit temperature sensor with an output voltage that is linearly proportional to the temperature in Celsius, making it more straight forward to use. Unlike other temperature sensors calibrated in Kelvin, the LM35 does not require the user to subtract a constant value to obtain Celsius scaling, simplifying the measurement process. The sensor offers a high level of accuracy, ensuring a typical error of just $\pm 0.5^\circ C$ at $25^\circ C$.

\subsection{DS18B20 - Digital Thermometer}

    Unlike the other sensors this one outputs already the temperature value in digital signal, making it easier to use. This will be helpful in oder to have a control value to measure the quality of the other sensors.

\newpage
\section{System Design}

    In order to design the system first it's necessary to define the temperature interval in which this circuit will work, thus it was define as $T \in [ 10^{\circ}; 40^{\circ} ]$. 
    The sensors used in this project have undesirable output behaviours, so it's necessary to design an Analog FrontEnd (AFE) for some of them. In this section it will be shown the design choices and calculations for the AFE's.

\subsection{Operational Amplifier}

    \textcolor{red}{Se calhar meter esta seccao noutro sitio}

    For the following AFE's it's important to choose an appropriate Operational Amplifier (OpAmp). 

    The desired characteristics are:

    $\cdot$ Rail-to-Rail output voltage.
    
    $\cdot$ Low power consumption
    
    $\cdot$ Low supply voltage

    $\cdot$ Low offset voltage

    \begin{table}[h]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Characteristic}         & \textbf{MCP6001}      & \textbf{TL084}   & \textbf{LM324}  \\ \hline
        \textbf{Max Output (V)}         &$(V+)-25mV$            & $(V+)$           & $(V+) - 1.5V$   \\ \hline
        \textbf{Minimum Output (V)}     &$(V-)+25mV$            & $(V-) + 1.5V$   & $(V-) + 150mV$  \\ \hline
        \textbf{Supply Range (V)}       & $1.8V$ to $6.0V$      & $4.5V$ to $40V$  & $3V$ to $36V$   \\ \hline
        \textbf{Offset (mV)}            & $\pm 4.5mV$             & $1mV$              & $\pm 3 mV$      \\ \hline
        \textbf{Max Output (mA)}        & $\pm 23 mA$ $(5.5V)$  & $10 mA$          & $\pm 30 mA$     \\ \hline
        \textbf{Idle Consumption}       & $100 \mu A $          & $1.4$ $mA$       & $240 \mu A$      \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \caption{Comparison of Key Parameters for MCP6001, TL084, and LM324}
    \end{table}

    With the characteristics the only choice for this system is the MCP6001. Even though it has the higher offset voltage, this is the only one that's able to be supplied with $Vs=3.3V$ and have a Rail-to-Rail output voltage, making it possible to supply the OpAmp with the MCU and still output the full ADC range.


\subsection{Analog FrontEnd (AFE) NTC}
\label{AFENTC}

    \subsubsection{ Resistance to Temperature Conversion }

    \textcolor{red}{ achei que ficava mais organizado com 2 seccoes se nao gostarem tambem acho que fica bem como estava }

    According to the \hyperref[requirements]{specification} and through the \textit{NTC}'s datasheet the interval for its resistance values is:
    
    $$R_{NTC} \in [~5,282k~;~19,98k~]$$

    For an accurate temperature reading the 
    \hyperref[eq:1]{ \textit{Steinhart-Hart} equation} was used .

    \begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
    \frac{1}{T} = A + B\cdot \ln(R_{NTC}) + C\cdot [\ln(R_{NTC})]^3
    \end{equation}

    In order to find the parameters $A$, $B$ and $C$, its necessary to use 3 points from the datasheet. 
    The points chosen were the two extremes and the middle point.
    
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{cases}
        
            R( 283,15 ) = 1,998\cdot 10^4 ~\Omega \\
            R( 298,15 ) = 10^4 ~\Omega\\
            R( 313,15 ) = 0,5282 \cdot 10^4 ~\Omega\\
        
        \end{cases}
        \Leftrightarrow
        \begin{cases}
            A = 1,3092 \cdot 10^{-3}\\
            B = 2,1439 \cdot 10^{-4}\\
            C = 9,6600 \cdot 10^{-8}\\
        
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}

    The simplest way to convert the resistance to voltage, is to use a voltage divider circuit.

   \begin{figure}[H] 
        \centering
        \includegraphics*[scale = 0.25]{images/voltagedivider.png}
        \caption{NTC voltage divider.}
        \label{wrap-fig:1}
    \end{figure}

    This approach  has a few problems: 

    $\cdot$ The output resistance is really high $R\parallel NTC$, 

    $\cdot$ The output voltage is highly non linear, which is a problem because this way some \textit{ADC} resolution is lost.

    The first problem is solved through a circuit with high impedance at the entrance and the second is somewhat mitigated by using a resistor value around $8K \Omega$. 
    \textcolor{red}{Vejam se acham se faz sentido ter codigo aqui. ~ To achieve this value, the beta model was used for the $NTC$ and through a python script, the resistor value was iterated until an almost linear output was achieved. See NtcTempToVoltage() function in the attached python script.}
    
    To achieve this value, the beta model was used for the $NTC$ and through the following python script, the resistor value was iterated until an almost linear output was achieved. 

    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
        vcc  = 3.3 
        Tmin = 10 + 273.15  #Minimum temperature in Kelvin
        Tmax = 40 + 273.15  #Maximum temperature in Kelvin
        R0   = 10*k         #Resistance at 25C
        T0   = 298.15       #25c -> K
        b    = 3965         #beta value (Datasheet)
        Rntc = R0*( exp( b*( (1/T) - (1/T0) ) ) ) #Beta model equation
        Vout = Rntc/(Rntc+R)
        Vout = Vout * vcc
        
        p = plot(Vout.subs(R,8*k) ,(T,Tmin,Tmax), xlabel='Temperature (K)', ylabel='$V_{out}$', title='Output Voltage vs Temperature (8k$\\Omega$)',show=False,axis_center=(282,1.3))
        #p.show()
        p = plot(Vout.subs(R,100*k),(T,Tmin,Tmax), xlabel='Temperature (K)', ylabel='$V_{out}$', title='Output Voltage vs Temperature (100k$\\Omega$)',show=False,axis_center=(282,0.15))
        #p.show()

        VTmax = Vout.evalf(subs={R:8*k,T:Tmax})
        VTmin = Vout.evalf(subs={R:8*k,T:Tmin})
        Slope = (VTmax - VTmin)/(Tmax - Tmin)
        inter = VTmax - Slope*Tmax

        print( "V(T = 40C): "+str( VTmax ) + " V\nV(T = 10C): " +str( VTmin )+" V" )
        print( "Slope : "+str( Slope ) )
        print( "Interception: "+str( inter ) )
        
    \end{lstlisting}
    ~
    
    Yielding the following results:
    
    ~

    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/VoutPorTemp.png}
            \caption{ $8K\Omega$ }
        \end{subfigure}\hfill

            \caption{$100K\Omega$}
        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{Output Voltage vs Temperature}
    \end{figure}

    With $R=8k$ the output signal is $V_{out} \in [1.31V;2.36V]$. 
    But the \textit{ADC} as resolution of $12$ bits and a voltage range of $3.3V$, meaning that to have the best resolution possible the signal needs an offset and a gain of $2.87$ and $-1.75$ respectively. 
    It's important to note that a $0.1V$ margin was added to $V_{out}$ in order to ensure that the \textit{AFE} works properly in the specified range.
    
    \subsubsection{Circuit Implementation}
    
    The most obvious way to achieve this values would be with a differential amplifier, 
    as seen in the following circuit.

     \begin{figure}[H] 
        \centering
        \includegraphics*[scale = 0.25]{images/AFENTCDiffAmp.png}
        \caption{NTC's AFE Differential Amplifier}
        \label{wrap-fig:1}
    \end{figure}

    Although in the simulation this yields the expected result, using the wheatstone with a precision OpAmp as bridge amplifier, it's possible to achieve gain and offset using less components, yielding better results in terms of power consumption and thermal noise. 

    
    \begin{figure}[H] 
        \centering
        \includegraphics*[scale = 0.25]{images/AFENTC.png}
        \caption{NTC's AFE topology}
        \label{wrap-fig:1}
    \end{figure}

    As already specified the $R_3$ value is $8K~\Omega$ and for the purpose circuit dimensioning the circuit 
    the positive node of the OpAmp will be treated as a variable $V_p$.

    \textcolor{red}{ Vejam se acham que o codigo devia ficar aqui.       Using python the circuit function $V_{out}(V_p)$(see function AfeNtc() in the attached python script, script.py): }

    Using the following python code the circuit function $V_{out}(V_p)$ is found:
       
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
        
        vcc         = 3.3
    
        it = -(vp/r2) + ( vcc - vp )/r1
        vo = vp - it*rf
        #Here the circuit's function is found
        print("Circuit Function: ")
        print( latex( factor(vo,vp) ) )

    \end{lstlisting}
    
    Providing the following expression:

    \begin{equation}
        V_{out} = V_p\left[ 1 + R_f\cdot\left(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}\right) \right] - V_{cc}\cdot\frac{R_f}{R_1}
    \end{equation}

    Now it's clear to see what part of the equation is responsible for the circuit gain and offset.
    
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{cases}
            V_{offset} = - V_{cc}\cdot\frac{R_f}{R_1}\\
            G = \left[ 1 + R_f\cdot\left(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}\right) \right]\\
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}

    Setting $R_f = 10K$ the values that satisfy the equation system are $R_1 = 9348 \Omega$ and $R_2 = 11760 \Omega$.
    In the simulation this values are a bit too close to the limits so in order to have better margins and to use the available resistors
    the final values are  $R_1 = 9.1K \Omega$ and $R_2 = 12K \Omega$.

    The theorical output voltage of the AFE circuit in function of the temperature will have the
    following graphic.
    \begin{figure}[H] 
        \centering
        \includegraphics*[scale = 0.6]{images/outuptafentc.png}
        \caption{NTC's AFE output voltage}
        \label{wrap-fig:1}
    \end{figure}

    From this graphic, the maximum and minimum voltages values can be extracted, so from them, the output voltage 
    will vary between $V_{outAFE} \in [3.25V;0.15V]$, from 10ºC to 40ºC, theoretically. These values are within the \textit{ADC} range, so no information will be lost.
\subsection{LM35}

    This integrated-circuit temperature sensor, generates an output
    voltage linearly proportional to the Centigrade temperature.

    $$V_{out} = 10^{-2}\cdot T$$

    Hence, in the specified conditions $V_{out}\in[0.1;0.4]$. 
    To increase resolution as done in \hyperref[AFENTC]{NTC's AFE subsection},
    it's needed to add gain and an offset. 
    For this purpose a differential amplifier can be used.  
    
    \begin{figure}[H] 
        \centering
        \includegraphics*[scale = 0.3]{images/DiffAmpLM35.png}
        \caption{LM35 Differential Amplifier.}
        \label{wrap-fig:1}
    \end{figure}

    Although this circuit achieves the expected output, the amount of components,
    increases noise and power consumption, thus the used topology was a non-inverting amplifier.

    \begin{figure}[H] 
        \centering
        \includegraphics*[scale = 0.2]{images/AFELM35.png}
        \caption{AFE for the LM35 sensor.}
        \label{AFELM35}
    \end{figure}

    This way the input impedance is high, only one OpAmp and two resistors are used.
    But this comes with the cost of lost resolution. With a gain of $7.8$ $V_{out}\in[0.78V,3.12V]$
    $0.78V$ or $23.6\%$ of range in the \textit{ADC} are lost.

    Graphically, the output voltage of the LM35 AFE is the following.

    \begin{figure}[H] 
        \centering
        \includegraphics*[scale = 0.5]{images/Outafelm35.png}
        \caption{LM35 AFE output voltage.}
        \label{AFELM35}
    \end{figure}
\subsection{Power Consumption}

    In modern electronic systems, power consumption plays a crucial role. This section analyzes the power consumption of the temperature meter system as a whole.
    So in order to determine the total power consumption, the power of all the resistances present in both AFE circuits were considerd and the theorical 
    typical consumption of the OpAmps, resulting in the next equation.
    
    \begin{equation}
        P_{total} =  P_{AFENTC} + P_{AFELM35}[W] 
    \end{equation}
    Where
    \begin{equation}
        P_{AFENTC} = \frac{(V_{CC} - V_{NTC})^2}{R_1} + \frac{(V_{CC} - V_{NTC})^2}{R_3} + \frac{V_{NTC}^2}{R_2} + \frac{(V_{NTC} - V_{Out_{AFENTC}})}{R_5} + I_{OpAmp} \cdot V_{CC} [W]
    \end{equation}
    And
    \begin{equation}
        P_{AFELM35} = \frac{(V_{LM35} - V_{Out{AFELM35}})^2}{R_b} + \frac{V_{LM35}^2}{R_a} + I_{OpAmp} \cdot V_{CC} [W]
    \end{equation}
    
    The total power will depend on the temperature on a second degree function, since the voltage function by temperature is a first degree, after the linearization.
    The power consumption graphic for each AFE circuit are the next.

    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}

            \caption{ NTC }
        \end{subfigure}\hfill
        \begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}

        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{NTC and LM35 AFEs power consumption.}
    \end{figure}

    The total power consumption graphic is then.
    \begin{figure}[H] 
        \centering
        \includegraphics*[scale = 0.5]{images/PowerTotal.png}
        \caption{AFEs total power consumption.}
    \end{figure}

    From the graphic above, the power consumption describes a parabolic, where the value of the power consumption increases with the 
    temperature, with a maximum value of $P_{total} = 1.93 mW$. So, both circuits delivered satisfactory results in this regard, 
    especially, the LM35 AFE circuit, where the consumption was in the order of the microWatts.
\subsection{Output Relay }
    
    Lastly the \textit{MCU} will turn on and off a fan. For this purpose 
    a relay will open and close the fan circuit. Because the \textit{MCU's I/O} 
    can't drive the relay a \textit{NPN} transistor is use to get enough current.
    Thus the following circuit also needs to be dimensioned. It's important to note
    that the diode is needed to protect the circuit.
    
    \begin{figure}[H] 
        \centering
        \includegraphics*[scale = 0.4]{images/RelayDrive.png}
        \caption{Relay circuit.}
        \label{wrap-fig:1}
    \end{figure}
    \textcolor{red}{PRECISA DE ENCHER CHOURICO AQUI}

    The voltage supply value for this circuit must be different form the AFE circuits that were presented,
    since the minimum supply voltage to operate the relay is $5V$. And for this voltage, the 
    current on the inductor present in the relay is $72mA$, according to the datasheet.
    
    So, considering $V_{BE} = 0.7V$, and $\beta = 150$ the equation to define the resistance of this circuit is the next.
    \begin{equation}
        R = \frac{I/O_{HIGH}-V_{BE}}{I_r}\cdot \beta\\
        \Leftrightarrow R = 5416.(6) \Omega
    \end{equation}

    The closest value available and the final value of this resistance will be $R = 5.1 k\Omega$.

\section{Simulations}
\subsection{NTC}
    
    For the purpose of testing the following circuit was designed.
    At first with linear voltage supply since as seen in \hyperref[AFENTC]{NTC's AFE} section, this voltage is almost linear.

    Producing the following results.
 
    \begin{figure}[H] 
        \centering
        \includegraphics*[scale = 0.3]{images/NTCLinearRes.png}
        \caption{Linear supply NTC test results.}
        \label{wrap-fig:1}
    \end{figure}

    Confirming the effectiveness of the \textit{AFE} circuit a more realistic
    circuit was then tested.

    \begin{figure}[H] 
        \centering
        \includegraphics*[scale = 0.6]{images/NTCRealTb.png}
        \caption{Realistic NTC test circuit.}
        \label{wrap-fig:1}
    \end{figure}
    
    With the following results.
    
    \begin{figure}[H] 
        \centering
        \includegraphics*[scale = 0.3]{images/NTCRealRes.png}
        \caption{Realistic NTC test results.}
        \label{wrap-fig:1}
    \end{figure}

    Comparing both results the difference is minimal.Confirming that the output is nearly linear in relation to the temperature variation.
    
    \begin{figure}[H] 
        \centering
        \includegraphics*[scale = 0.3]{images/NTCRealLinearComp.png}
        \caption{NTC Linear and Realistic results comparison.}
        \label{wrap-fig:1}
    \end{figure}


\subsection{LM35}

    For this sensor the simulation is straight forward, since the output is linear and proportional to the temperature, 
    it can be simulated with a variable voltage supply. 
    
    The circuit used to test was the same seen in the \hyperref[AFELM35]{lm35 design section}.
    Giving the following results, confirming that this approach works as expected. 
    
    \begin{figure}[H] 
        \centering
        \includegraphics*[scale = 0.15]{images/LM35AFERes.jpeg}
        \caption{LM35 AFE test results.}
        \label{wrap-fig:1}
    \end{figure}

\subsection{Monte-Carlo Analysis} 
    
    The Monte-Carlo simulation is needed for the sake of testing our circuits results variation with the true values of the resistances considering 
    the normal distribution of those values. 

    This values can be found on the following interval.
    \begin{equation}
        R_{real} \in [R_{ideal} - tol; R_{ideal} + tol] 
    \end{equation}
    Where the variable \textit{tol} will depend with the serie of resistances used. 
    In this work, the serie used is the E12, with a maximum tolerance of 5\%. So to test the results of
    the output of the two AFE circuits, thirty simulations were made to assure the reliability of the normal distribution.

    The results for the NTC AFE are the following.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics*[scale = 0.3]{images/montecarlo ntc.png}
        \caption{NTC AFE Monte-Carlo test results}
        \label{wrap-fig:1}
    \end{figure}

    And the results for the LM35 AFE circuits.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics*[scale = 0.3]{images/montecarlo lm35.png}
        \caption{LM35 AFE Monte-Carlo test results}
        \label{wrap-fig:1}
    \end{figure}

    By analysing the results of the Monte-Carlo simulation of the NTC AFE, first of all, we can conclude that the
    slope of the output voltage will be almost the same, the only difference will be in the offset of this function.
    This variation on the offset will unfortunately alter the final result for all temperatures, but the maximum deviation is just 3ºC, in a worts case scenario.

    One other implication of this offset is the values for lower temperatures, where the output would be greater than 3.3V, so the OpAmp will saturate and the voltage will stay at 3.3V.

    For the results of the LM35 AFE Monte-Carlo test, the biggest difference between the thirty simulations is the slope of the output voltage,
    because the resistances in this circuit only affects it's gain. This consequence is more problematic at higher temperatures, since the input voltage is greater at this values.

    \subsection{Power Consumption}
    
    In LTSpice, in order to determine the total power consumption of both AFE circuits, we only need to check the power of the voltage supply.
    Yielding the following results: 
        
    \begin{figure}[H] 
        \centering
        \includegraphics*[scale = 0.3]{images/PowerConsumption.png}
        \caption{System Power Consumption.}
        \label{wrap-fig:1}
    \end{figure}

    The power consumption increases with temperature, confirming the theorical values obtained earlier, but the curve discribed is not a parabola,
    despite presenting a similar form. After analysing the power consumption of each device, the conclusion was that the OpAmp present in the NTC AFE had a 
    different behavior from the expected, where instead of having a constant consumption, it had the following graphic.
 
    \begin{figure}[H] 
        \centering
        \includegraphics*[scale = 0.3]{images/PowerAmpop.png}
        \caption{OpAmp NTC AFE Power Consumption.}
        \label{wrap-fig:1}
    \end{figure}

    This behavior will not affect negatively the final implementation of the circuit, although the power consumption of the simulated system was sligthly above the expected, 
    the maximum value reached the $2.37mW$, instead of the $1.93mW$ theoretically calculated.
